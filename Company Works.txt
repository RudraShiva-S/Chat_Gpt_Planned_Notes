Assume yourself as a company senior and I am a 3years experience java developer what sort of task you gonna give me on daily basis 


ChatGPT said:
Great — as a senior overseeing a Java developer with 3 years of experience, my goal would be to gradually challenge you, ensure you’re growing, and at the same time contribute meaningfully to the project.

Here’s a breakdown of the kinds of tasks I’d assign you on a daily or weekly basis, depending on sprint cycles:

1. Feature Development
Design and implement RESTful APIs (Spring Boot)

Build and integrate business logic for modules (e.g., booking service, payment processing, user profile management)

CRUD operations with JPA/Hibernate on PostgreSQL/MySQL

Example:
“Implement an endpoint to filter properties by location, date range, and price in the booking service.”

2. Code Review & Refactoring
Review junior developers’ pull requests

Refactor legacy code to adopt better design patterns or Java 8+ features

Example:
“Refactor the property listing controller to extract logic into service layers and add DTOs with mapstruct.”

3. Unit & Integration Testing
Write JUnit and Mockito-based unit tests

Create integration tests using Spring Boot Test with embedded DBs (e.g., H2)

Example:
“Write test coverage for the ReservationService to handle overlapping bookings and invalid inputs.”

4. Bug Fixing & Optimization
Investigate and resolve production or QA-reported bugs

Optimize slow queries or memory-heavy services

Example:
“Fix the pagination issue in the host dashboard where results aren’t ordered correctly.”

5. Collaboration & Documentation
Attend daily standups, grooming, and sprint planning

Write or update internal documentation or API specs (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)

Example:
“Document the new authentication flow and update the Postman collection for the team.”

6. Occasional Architectural Discussions / PoCs
Participate in design discussions with the team

Build PoCs for new integrations (e.g., payment gateway, caching with Redis)

Example:
“Research and prototype a caching layer using Redis for the most frequently queried listings.”

Here’s a sample weekly task breakdown for a 3-year experienced Java developer on an Airbnb-like Spring Boot project, assuming a standard agile sprint:

Week Overview
Sprint Goal: Implement “Host Property Management” module
Tech Stack: Java 17, Spring Boot, JPA, PostgreSQL, Redis, REST, JUnit, Swagger

Monday
Task 1: Review requirements for "Add New Property" feature

Task 2: Design Property, Host, and Address entities (ERD & JPA models)

Task 3: Create initial REST API contract using Swagger/OpenAPI

Task 4: Attend sprint planning

Tuesday
Task 1: Implement POST /api/properties to create new property

Task 2: Use DTOs with MapStruct to convert between entities and responses

Task 3: Save data using JPA with validation

Wednesday
Task 1: Write unit tests for property creation using JUnit + Mockito

Task 2: Add integration test using Spring Boot Test + H2

Task 3: Review 2 PRs from teammates (focus on test coverage and SOLID)

Thursday
Task 1: Implement GET /api/properties?hostId=... with pagination

Task 2: Add filtering by status (active, archived)

Task 3: Optimize query using @Query and fetch join in JPA

Friday
Task 1: Fix bugs reported by QA on property form validations

Task 2: Refactor service layer to move validation logic to a utility class

Task 3: Update README and Postman API collection

Wrap-up: Demo the completed feature in sprint review

Let me know if you'd like this in a Trello or Jira board style layout — or want a project-based task assignment with deliverables instead.

Task relevant to today's industry 
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — here’s a modern, industry-relevant weekly task plan tailored to today’s best practices and tools used in backend Java development, especially in microservices or SaaS environments.

Project Context:
Building a microservice for property booking in a distributed system using:
Spring Boot, Java 17, JPA, Kafka, Redis, Docker, REST APIs, CI/CD, Git

Daily Breakdown (Industry-Ready Tasks)
Monday: API Design & Setup
Task 1: Design POST /bookings and GET /bookings/{id} endpoints

Task 2: Define request/response models using Swagger/OpenAPI

Task 3: Initialize a new Spring Boot microservice with relevant modules (Web, JPA, Validation, Lombok)

Tuesday: Business Logic & Data Layer
Task 1: Implement Booking entity and relationships (Property, User)

Task 2: Build BookingService with business rules (date validation, user limits)

Task 3: Use JPA repository with native query to detect overlapping bookings

Wednesday: Event-Driven Integration
Task 1: Publish Kafka event (BookingCreatedEvent) after successful booking

Task 2: Add Kafka producer config and use @KafkaTemplate

Task 3: Write a consumer skeleton in the notification microservice (if time permits)

Thursday: Testing & Redis Caching
Task 1: Write unit tests for BookingService using JUnit 5 + Mockito

Task 2: Create an integration test with embedded Kafka

Task 3: Add Redis cache for GET /bookings/{id} using @Cacheable

Friday: Docker & DevOps
Task 1: Write a Dockerfile and docker-compose with PostgreSQL and Kafka

Task 2: Push image to internal registry (simulate with local Docker)

Task 3: Setup GitHub Actions for CI (test + build + Docker push)

Task 4: Finalize API Postman collection + write short wiki/doc

Why These Tasks Are Industry Relevant
Kafka: Event-driven architecture is a must in scalable systems.

Redis: Used for performance, especially on read-heavy endpoints.

Docker & CI/CD: Daily part of deployment pipelines in most companies.

Testing: Mocking, embedded test tools are vital for clean pipelines.

OpenAPI/Swagger: Every serious team now documents APIs.

Would you like a version focused on cloud-native development (AWS/GCP) or monolithic enterprise apps too?
